I’m a **cse student** still **learning, experimenting, and occasionally breaking the matrix**.  
Currently leveling up in **AI, software engineering & all things futuristic**, and *secretly plotting how to bend reality with code.*

### 🚀 Why I Build

I don’t just want to *use* technology — I want to **reshape it**.  
To build things that feel a little bit like magic,  
the kind that makes people say *“Wait... how is this even possible?”*

Still learning. Still experimenting.  
But that’s the best part of the journey.
